  <p>No more “Are you done yet?” Coordel lets you indicate which tasks are blocking your work. It notifies you immediately when tasks are completed and you can now start your work.</p>
  <p>Coordel is designed to let you automate your own work. In order to automate, you need a simple way to know what you can do. If you, or someone else, must complete one task before starting work on another, the first task is blocking the second. </p>
  <p>Most of the time, you don’t know the order of tasks right away. With Coordel, you add tasks as you think of them, along with any blocking between tasks. Coordel automatically manages the order of execution.</p>
  <p>Click on the "Blocked" list to see all the tasks that you have agreed to, but that are blocked by others. As you or someone else completes blocking tasks, the tasks they blocked automatically move into your <a href="/preview?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list. No more following up, calling or e-mailing, especially because the deliverables from the blocking tasks have moved into your Workspace automatically. No more “What’s the latest version of that document?” or “Could you re-send that?” What you need is there. </p>
