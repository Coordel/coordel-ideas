  <p>Avoid confusion about when you will start your work. Set the defer date of a task to when you intend to start working on it. Your team members will be notified automatically.</p>
  <p>When your <a href="/preview?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list is getting too long, you can apply the “Getting Things Done” methodology by using the <a href="/preview?p=feature&f=turbo">Turbo Wizard</a> to trim it down to what is manageable today. If you are not going to start working on a task today, you can defer it. All tasks you have deferred to a later date can be viewed and accessed in the Deferred list. When the defer date arrives, the task will automatically move back to your <a href="/preview?p=feature&f=current">Current</a> list</p>
